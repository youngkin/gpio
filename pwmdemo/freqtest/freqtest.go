// This program visually demonstrates the the association between rpio.SetFreq() and
// rpio.SetDutyCycle(). rpio.SetFreq() sets the PWM clock frequency. rpio.SetDutyCycle()
// specifies how long a pin is in HIGH state (dutyLen) vs. the length of the containing
// cycle (cycleLen). Duty cycle is the ratio between dutyLen and cycleLen. So a dutyLen
// of 5 with a cycleLen of 10 would have a duty cycle of 0.5, or 50%.
//
// The relationship demonstrated by this program is more specifically the relationship
// between the clock frequency and the cycle length (cycleLen in SetDutyCycle()). This
// ratio sets the frequency of the LED.
//
// Given a clock frequency of 100,000 and a cycle length of 25,000, the LED Hz is 4,
// and it blinks 4 times per second. If the cycle length is changed to 400,000, the
// LED Hz is 0.25, or once every 4 seconds. And finally, if the cycle length is 1,000
// the LED Hz is 100. At 100Hz, the LED will appear to be continuously on, i.e., not
// blinking.
//
// The frequency at the LED dictates where flickering will occur. When flickering occurs depends
// on the type of light source. For example, eliminating flicker in a neon light requires a
// frequency of about 120Hz. Other light sources, like LEDs, don't flicker until a much lower
// threshold, for some people around 50Hz. In my testing, using this program on a Raspberry Pi
// 3B+, I can detect flickering below 45Hz using my peripheral vision. I don't detect
// flickering in an LED until around 35Hz when looking directly at the LED. Using the default
// clock frequency of 9,600,000, 35Hz occurs with a cycle value of 275,000 and 45Hz with a cycle
// value of 210,000.
//
// The range of 4688 to 9,600,000 for the clock frequency was chosen because values outside
// that range caused the LED to exhibit inconsistent behavior. The program will enforce
// this range.
//
// The range of 4 to 38,400,000 for the cycle length is somewhat arbitrary. When the clock
// frequency is set to 9,600,000 and the cycle length is set to 38,400,000, the LED will
// blink at 0.25Hz, or once every 4 seconds. 4 was chosen as the lower bound because
// I arbitrarily decided that the duty cycle would be calculated as the cycle/4. When
// a cycle of 4 is chosen the duty cycle will be 1 (it needs to be an integer > 0).
// With a duty cycle of cycle/4, the power going to the LED will be 25% of full power,
// resulting the brightness to be set to 25% of full brightness. This is bright enough to
// be easily seen, but not so bright as to be uncomfortable to look at.
//
// BCM pin 18 is used as it is a hardware PWM pin. Any hardware PWM pin can be used if desired.
// The other hardware PWM pins are BCM pins 12, 13, and 19.
